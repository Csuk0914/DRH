Run this code:<p>
1. Download fastser-rcnn codes and compile faster-rcnn codes 
2. Download the model from  "CNN Image Retrieval Learns from BoW: Unsupervised Fine-Tuning with Hard Examples"
3.For sliding window strategy, run extract_slide_reg_feats.py to extract feature.
3.To train the deep region hashing, run train_hash_net.py 
4.To evaluate the performace, you can just run evalutate.py.
Note. The trained model is too big to upload to github. We will upload it later to other platforms.
